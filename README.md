# 📌 Project Overview

TaskForge is an enterprise-level backend application developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** that enables organizations to efficiently manage employees, managers, and task assignments.

The application follows **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure that every user only has access to the resources and actions permitted by their role.

The project demonstrates real-world backend architecture including authentication, authorization, task management, secure API development, email verification, and file uploads.

# 🚀 Business Problem

Imagine a software company with multiple departments and employees.

Without a centralized task management system:

- Managers struggle to assign work efficiently.
- Employees lose track of assigned tasks.
- Admins cannot monitor organizational progress.
- Task ownership becomes unclear.
- Deadlines are missed due to poor communication.

TaskForge solves these challenges by providing a secure role-based platform where managers assign tasks, employees update progress, and administrators oversee the entire workflow.

# 👥 User Roles

The application supports three user roles.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| 👑 Admin | Full control over users, managers, employees, and tasks |
| 👨‍💼 Manager | Create, assign, and monitor tasks |
| 👨‍💻 Employee | View assigned tasks and update progress |
